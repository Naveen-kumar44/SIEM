# SIEM
I am excited to share that my team and I have recently completed a comprehensive document on achieving cyber resilience through the building of a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system using open-source tools. Our SIEM covers various aspects, including intrusion detection system, file auditor, network analyzer, and other advanced features of Wazuh.
Our document provides a detailed guide on how to configure and maintain the SIEM. We have used Suricata for IDS, Filebeat for the file auditor, Zeek for the network analyzer, and Wazuh for other advanced features. The centralized dashboard allows for easy monitoring of events and alerts.
I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge my teammates, Uppalapati Bhargav, Sneha Manalipadam, and Geetha Reddy Venna, for their hard work and contributions to this project.

Our document offers practical insights and step-by-step instructions that can help organizations enhance their cybersecurity posture. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, it is crucial to have a robust and effective SIEM system in place. I believe that our document can help organizations achieve this goal.
